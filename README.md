    "billing phone",
    "address line", 
    "country code", 
    "city", 
    "state", 
    "zip code",
  );
        
var shippingDetails = new ShippingDetails("shipping name", 
     "shipping email", 
     "shipping phone",
     "address line", 
     "country code", 
     "city", 
     "state", 
     "zip code",
  );
     
```

2- Create object of PaymentSDKConfiguration and fill it with your credentials and payment details.

  var configuration = PaymentSdkConfigurationDetails(
        profileId: "profile id",
        serverKey: "your server key",
        clientKey: "your client key",
        cartId: "cart id",
        cartDescription: "cart desc",
        merchantName: "merchant name",
        screentTitle: "Pay with Card",
        billingDetails: billingDetails,

        locale: PaymentSdkLocale.EN, //PaymentSdkLocale.AR or PaymentSdkLocale.DEFAULT 
        amount: "amount in double",
        currencyCode: "Currency code",
        merchantCountryCode: "2 chars iso country code",
    );
     
```

      setState(() {
        if (event["status"] == "success") {
          // Handle transaction details here.
          var transactionDetails = event["data"];
          print(transactionDetails);
          
          if (transactionDetails["isSuccess"]) {
            print("successful transaction");
          } else {
            print("failed transaction");
          }
        } else if (event["status"] == "error") {
          // Handle error here.
        } else if (event["status"] == "event") {
